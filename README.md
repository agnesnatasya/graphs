# Time Complexity Visualizer #

This is the backend utility of the repository.

The web application is hosted using AWS amplify and this branch contains the AWS Lambda and API Gateway source and configuration. 

To make changes to the configured Lambda and API Gateway, go to the directory `amplify/backend/function/timeComplexity` and `amplify/backend/api/timeComplexity` respectively.

If AWS Amplify CLI is configured, you can do `amplify push` after the changes.
